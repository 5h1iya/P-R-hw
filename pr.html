    <h4>
    Guru Nanak, Bala, and Mardana come upon a community while travelling where one man controls all the water from the well! Until Guru Nanak established a fresh well down the hill that people could use for free, the man coerced people for drinking water. The man is furious and sends a boulder down the hill to trample the thieves who destroyed his business. With his hand, Guru Ji stops the boulder. The man was very humbled and decided to alter his behaviour. That boulder still bears the handprint of Guru Nanak.

    <h4>
      Guru Nanak, accompanied by his faithful companions Mardana and Bala, journeyed to the region of Kashmir and arrived in Sri Nagar. The residents of the city recognized him due to his aura and brilliance, and were honored to spend time with him and gain wisdom from him. In the city lived a learned scholar named Brahm Das, who was well-known for his devotion to the goddess and possession of mystical abilities. Upon hearing of the arrival of a renowned Guru, Brahm Das believed that he was superior in knowledge and powers and decided to showcase his abilities by flying to the Guru's location. But upon his arrival, he was unable to find the Guru and the people present appeared to be talking to someone who was not there. Embarrassed, Brahm Das tried to fly away but found he could not, so he had to walk back home. The following day, he walked to the Guru's location and finally saw him, realizing that his ego had blinded him from seeing the Guru's presence.
